## B-tag data

Instructions to use create the root files with `getBTagEfficiencies.py`, and to use them with `BTagWeightTool` in [`corrections/BTaggingTool.py`](../BTagWeightTool) are available in the parent directory [`corrections`](..#b-tagging-tools).

Examples of efficiency maps per jet flavor, and as a function of jet pT versus jet eta for the mutau analysis in 2017 are shown [here](https://ineuteli.web.cern.ch/ineuteli/btag/2017/?match=mutau).
